<h1 style="font-size:28px">Myth Related To Dairy Products</h1>
<center>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify" >Children grow rapidly in the first 5 years of life and have high energy needs. They only have a small stomach, so they need nutrient-dense foods to support them as they grow. Whole milk and whole milk products provide energy, protein, vitamins and minerals to support growth and development. Milk also provides essential nutrients for growth and development and helps protect teeth against tooth decay. </p>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify" >The amount of minerals in our bones ( bone density) continues to increase until the age of thirty-five, but then the situation changes and we slowly lose bone density. Milk contributes 19% of the calcium intake in the diet of British adults.During pregnancy and breastfeeding, it is important for women to have enough calcium in their diet to meet both their own nutritional needs and those of their developing babies. You don't need to increase your calcium intake, but getting enough calcium is important to limit the loss of calcium from your bones during this time. Women over 50 are at increased risk of developing bone disease. During menopause, women can lose calcium stores in their bones which is a risk factor for fractures. In postmenopausal women and the elderly, several studies have shown that increasing milk slows the rate of bone loss. As we age, milk and other dairy products add nutritional value to our diets. Their soft and creamy texture makes them suitable for the elderly with dental or swallowing problems. Higher-fat dairy products such as cream, butter, and soft cheese can add nutrients and calories to old foods, helping people with less appetite to maintain their weight. Allergies and intolerances to milkCow's milk allergy affects 36 in 100 infants and toddlers. Symptoms usually appear in the first few months of life and can include immediate respiratory symptoms and swelling, which can lead to rashes and heartburn. eczema, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Most babies get past milk allergy by the age of five. Milk allergy in older children and adults is quite rare. More and more people are intolerant of lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. Affecting 1,520 percent of the population, it is more likely among Africans and Asians. people than those with irritable bowel syndrome. It is not an allergic disease but an inability to digest lactose because the body produces low levels of lactase, the enzyme responsible for digesting lactose. Lactose intolerance can occur temporarily in children and adults after an attack of gastroenteritis. Symptoms include diarrhea, bloating, and discomfort. Lactose is present in similar amounts in the milk of cows, goats and sheep.The only treatment is to limit or avoid lactose in the diet. The response of some people is "dose related"; they can tolerate the milk in tea, but a glass of milk would cause symptoms. Lactose-free milk and yogurt are believed to help people with lactose intolerance while providing the nutritional benefits of dairy products. A wide range of alternatives to milk is available at the supermarket. These include soybeans, oats, hemp, rice, and a range of nut milks such as almond, hazelnut, coconut, and cashew. Aside from soybeans, plant-based alternatives tend to be much lower in protein and all low in calcium. If you choose a herbal alternative, choose one fortified with calcium and vitamin B12.</p>
